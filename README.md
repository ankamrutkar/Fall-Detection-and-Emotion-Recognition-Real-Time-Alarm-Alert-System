# Fall-Detection-and-Emotion-Recognition-Real-Time-Alarm-Alert-System
This project presents a real-time system for enhancing industrial worker safety through the integration of fall detection and facial emotion recognition. The system employs the YOLO model to accurately detect falls based on posture analysis, and simultaneously assesses worker emotional state. Upon detection of a fall or the identification of heightened emotional distress, an audible alarm is triggered to alert nearby personnel and facilitate timely intervention. This approach aims to provide a proactive safety mechanism, minimizing response times and mitigating potential risks in industrial environments.
